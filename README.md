# UFOs

## Overview
### *Purpose of Project*
This project was designed to create a webpage using javascript and html that will display a table of UFO sighting data. The table is filterable on 5 different inputs: date, city, state, country, and shape. When the user inputs a change in any of these filterable fields, the table updates and presents only the data that matches their search criteria.

## Results
The initial table loads with all data visible. Once a specific date is entered, the table will update to show results that only match that specific date. As shown in this example, the date was entered as "1/10/2010" and so the table is only showing results from that date.

In this example, the city has been input as "cleveland", and the results have updated to filter only those sightings matching that specific criteria.
